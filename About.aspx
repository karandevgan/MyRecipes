        <h2>Who made this website?</h2>
        <p>
            This whole idea was of two engineering graduates of Guru Nanak Dev Enginnering College, Ludhiana.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Karanpal Singh, 3rd Year, Computer Scince and Enginnering</li>
            <li>Gursimran Singh, 3rd Year, Computer Science and Engineering</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            This is initial implementation of the idea during the 6 weeks Industrial Training.
